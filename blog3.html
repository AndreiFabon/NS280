            <p>Squeak. Squeak.</p>

            <p>The sound of my sister wiping her shoes before stepping onto the court. Her sneakers squeak softly, nearly drowned out by the bounce of the ball and the roar of the crowd. She‚Äôs undersized. She‚Äôs Filipino. She‚Äôs chasing a dream in a game that doesn‚Äôt forgive girls like her for being small.</p>

            <p>But still, she walks.</p>

            <p>She walks anyway, because her story isn‚Äôt about fitting into the mold. It‚Äôs about breaking it. Every step she takes on that court is an act of resistance. Every step carries the weight of her future dreams and her own rising success. But each step also carries self-doubt, the sting of discouraging comments, and the burden of being overlooked. For her size, for her gender, for who she is in today‚Äôs world. All her relentless hard work, never seen, never praised.</p>

            <p>Her steps remind me of the young M√©tis girls and women who never got to take theirs. The lives of these young leaders were stolen. Viciously, brutally, and far too soon. Unlike my sister, these girls will never be given the opportunity to chase their dreams. The beautiful story they could have curated themselves had their curtains closed before they could even share.</p>

            <p>To honour each of their short-lived stories, over 1,800 moccasin vamps were created through Walking With Our Sisters. This project‚Äôs mission was to showcase hundreds of unfinished moccasins to represent the story of each girl that never got to fully take place. Like the moccasins, these girls‚Äô stories were never finished, but the vamps' creativity and uniqueness remind us of the stories these girls were able to create with their short time.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Keeptwo, Suzanne. 2016. "Unfinished moccasins commemorate murdered and missing indigenous women." Anishinabek News, January 18, 2016. <a href="https://anishinabeknews.ca/2016/01/18/unfinished-moccasins-commemorate-murdered-and-missing-indigenous-women/">https://anishinabeknews.ca/2016/01/18/unfinished-moccasins-commemorate-murdered-and-missing-indigenous-women/</a></p>

            <p>Their incomplete shoes will never get to hold the same weight as my sister‚Äôs shoes, but this doesn‚Äôt make them any less beautiful. If anything, it shows that an unfinished story can still be beautiful. Yet it‚Äôs truly a shame and a disgrace to never let these individuals flourish.</p>

            <p>M√©tis women today still face struggles that inhibit them from flourishing. ‚ÄúConnected by economic, social and political marginalization, racism, and misogyny woven into the fabric of Canadian society,‚Äù Maron Bueller says. The current framework of our society is built on unfair viewpoints on age, gender, culture, social values. These core things affect the young M√©tis dreamers in our society today. ‚ÄúHealth is greater than just physical health, and often determined or impacted by social, political and economic influences.‚Äù (M√©tis Centre 2008, 3). To chase a dream is hard, but to chase a dream even those deeply rooted in the very foundations of our society, built to slow you down, is not only difficult, it is scary. To think of the toll it can take on a young M√©tis girl‚Äôs mind to fight against society just to achieve what you believe is right.</p>

            <p>And yet, they continue to walk forward, one step at a time.</p>

            <p>Every step forward, every story shared, is part of something bigger. In M√©tis culture, it is called Keeoukaywin, which means ‚Äúway of visiting.‚Äù When one of these girls wins, no matter how small, it is a collective win. As each victory is shared, we not only share stories and keep things in memory, but it can be much deeper.</p>

            <p>It inspires another girl to take her step forward, no matter how scary.</p>

            <p>Keeoukaywin is sacred, and it can bring about the change we need for young M√©tis women. ‚ÄúWomen are sacred‚Ä¶ Now is the time of the sacred feminine‚Äù (Menard, Andrea, 2018 March 3, 2:18 - 2:32). Women can come together, to empower each other to move forward, step by step. Adding onto the momentum and weight of each step, as the thundering step under each one of these girls will be heard all around the world, bringing about change. So that stories of hundreds of girls aren‚Äôt represented through creating moccasin vamps, but rather their victories and success will be shared throughout the world.</p>

            <p>For a long time, this land was called Terra Nullius, which means ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs land.‚Äù But no land is empty, no place should be untouched. No ground should be unwalked. So through Keeoukaywin let us not only share stories, but rather empower and inspire each other to walk the steps that many before couldn't take. Let us do right by them.</p>

            <p>One step at a time.</p>
